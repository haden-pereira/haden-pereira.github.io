# Welcome

Hi there! 👋 

Welcome to my little corner of the internet. My name is Haden Pereira, and this is my blog hosted on GitHub Pages. I'm a budding cybersecurity enthusiast, just starting to explore the vast and fascinating world of digital security. 

This space is where I document my journey, share what I learn, and hopefully connect with others who share the same passion. I'm still finding my way, but every step forward is a step closer to mastering the art of cybersecurity.

Feel free to explore, leave feedback, or just say hi. Let's learn and grow together!
